A browser-based AI prototype for querying through Logitech's 2025 Impact Report (Proof of Concept).

# Logitech Sustainability Assistant (2025 Prototype)

## 🎯 The Problem
Logitech's "Design for Sustainability" (DfS) goals rely on engineers making data-driven decisions early in the prototyping phase. However, critical data—like **CarbonClarity™** coefficients, **Next Life Plastics** targets, and **LCA (Life Cycle Assessment)** metrics—is often locked away in dense, 100+ page PDF reports. Manually searching these documents creates friction and slows down sustainable innovation.

## 💡 The Solution (Prototype)
This project demonstrates an **AI-powered "Chat with Data" interface**. It models how a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool could allow R&D teams to:
* **Instantly query** complex sustainability metrics using natural language.
* **Accelerate decision-making** by retrieving specific carbon impact data in seconds.
* **Democratize access** to the 2025 Impact Report for non-technical stakeholders.
