A browser-based AI prototype for querying through Logitech's 2025 Impact Report (Proof of Concept).

# Logitech Sustainability Assistant (2025 Prototype)

##  The Problem
Logitech's "Design for Sustainability" (DfS) goals rely on engineers making data-driven decisions early in the prototyping phase. However, critical data such as **CarbonClarity™** coefficients, **Next Life Plastics** targets, and **LCA (Life Cycle Assessment)** metrics are often not easy to find in the dense, 100+ page PDF reports. Manually searching these documents is time consuming and slows down sustainable innovation.

##  The Solution (Prototype)
This project demonstrates an **AI-powered "Chat with Data" interface**. It models how a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool could allow R&D teams to:
* **Instantly query** complex sustainability metrics using natural language.
* **Cut down decision-making time** by retrieving specific carbon impact data in seconds.
* Help provide **Easier access** to the 2025 Impact Report for non-technical stakeholders.
